**Py**\ thon **E**\ lliptic **C**\ urve cryptography **S**\ ide-**C**\ hannel **A**\ nalysis toolkit.

**pyecsca** aims to fill a gap in SCA tooling for Elliptic Curve Cryptography, it focuses on
black-box implementations of ECC and presents a way to extract implementation information
about a black-box implementation of ECC through side-channels.

It currently provides:

.. card:: Enumeration

    Enumeration of millions of possible ECC implementation configurations (see :doc:`notebook/configuration_space`)

.. card:: Simulation

    Simulation and execution tracing of key generation, ECDH and ECDSA (see :doc:`notebook/simulation`)

.. card:: Code generation

    Synthesis of C implementations of ECC for embedded devices, given any implementation configuration (see :doc:`notebook/codegen`),
    CPU-level emulation of implementations (see :doc:`notebook/emulator`)

.. card:: Trace acquisition

    Trace acquisition using PicoScope/ChipWhisperer oscilloscopes (see :doc:`notebook/measurement`)

.. card:: Trace processing

    Trace processing capabilities, e.g. signal-processing, filtering, averaging, cutting, aligning (:doc:`api/pyecsca.sca`)

.. card:: Trace visualization

    Trace visualization using holoviews and datashader (see :doc:`notebook/visualization`)

.. card:: Smartcard communication

    Communication via PCSC/LEIA with a smartcard target (see :doc:`notebook/smartcards`)

.. card:: Reverse-engineering

    Reverse-engineering of black-box ECC via RPA-RE and ZVP-RE methods (see :doc:`notebook/re/rpa` and :doc:`notebook/re/zvp`)

**pyecsca** consists of three repositories:

.. grid:: 1 1 3 3

    .. grid-item-card::  Core

        The `core <https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca>`_ repository contains the core of the
        functionality, except the code generation and notebooks.

    .. grid-item-card::  Codegen

        The `codegen <https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca-codegen>`_ repository contains
        the code generation functionality.

    .. grid-item-card::  Notebook

        The `notebook <https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca-notebook>`_ repository contains
        example notebooks that showcase functionality of the toolkit.
