"""
Provides several implementations of an element of ℤₙ.

The base class :py:class:`Mod` dynamically
dispatches to the implementation chosen by the runtime configuration of the library
(see :py:class:`pyecsca.misc.cfg.Config`). A Python integer based implementation is available under
:py:class:`RawMod`. A symbolic implementation based on sympy is available under :py:class:`SymbolicMod`. If
`gmpy2` is installed, a GMP based implementation is available under :py:class:`GMPMod`. If `python-flint` is
installed, a flint based implementation is available under :py:class:`FlintMod`.
