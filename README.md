## Functionality

**pyecsca** aims to fill a gap in SCA tooling for Elliptic Curve Cryptography, it focuses on
black-box implementations of ECC and presents a way to extract implementation information
about a black-box implementation of ECC through side-channels. The main goal of **pyecsca**
is to be able to reverse engineer the curve model, coordinate system, addition formulas, scalar
multiplier and even finite-field implementation details.

It is currently in an alpha stage of development and thus only provides:
 - Enumeration of millions of possible ECC implementation configurations (see [notebook/configuration_space](https://neuromancer.sk/pyecsca/notebook/configuration_space.html))
 - Simulation and execution tracing of key generation, ECDH and ECDSA (see [notebook/simulation](https://neuromancer.sk/pyecsca/notebook/simulation.html))
 - Synthesis of C implementations of ECC for embedded devices, given any implementation configuration (see [notebook/codegen](https://neuromancer.sk/pyecsca/notebook/codegen.html))
 - Trace acquisition using PicoScope/ChipWhisperer oscilloscopes (see [notebook/measurement](https://neuromancer.sk/pyecsca/notebook/measurement.html))
 - Trace processing capabilities, e.g. signal-processing, filtering, averaging, cutting, aligning ([pyecsca.sca](https://neuromancer.sk/pyecsca/api/pyecsca.sca.html))
 - Trace visualization using holoviews and datashader (see [notebook/visualization](https://neuromancer.sk/pyecsca/notebook/visualization.html))
 - Communication via PCSC/LEIA with a smartcard target (see [notebook/smartcards](https://neuromancer.sk/pyecsca/notebook/smartcards.html))

**pyecsca** consists of three packages:
 - the core: https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca
 - the codegen package: https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca-codegen
 - the notebook package: https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca-notebook

*pyecsca* contains data from the [Explicit-Formulas Database](https://www.hyperelliptic.org/EFD/index.html) by Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange.
The data was partially changed, to make working with it easier.

It also supports working with [Riscure](https://www.riscure.com) Inspector trace sets, which are of a proprietary format.
